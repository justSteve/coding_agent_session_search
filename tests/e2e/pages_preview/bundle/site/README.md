# cass Perf Archive

Synthetic performance fixture

## About This Archive

This is an encrypted, searchable archive of AI coding agent conversations
generated by [cass](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search).

## Security

- All data is encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Password-based key derivation uses Argon2id
- The archive can be safely hosted on public servers
- No data is accessible without the correct password

## How to Open

1. Host these files on any static web server
2. Open index.html in a modern browser
3. Verify the fingerprint matches your records
4. Enter your password to decrypt

## Technical Details

- Encryption: AES-256-GCM with chunked streaming
- KDF: Argon2id (64MB memory, 3 iterations)
- Search: SQLite with FTS5 (runs in browser via sql.js)
- Requires: SharedArrayBuffer (COOP/COEP headers)

## Files

- `index.html` - Entry point
- `config.json` - Public encryption parameters (no secrets)
- `integrity.json` - SHA256 hashes for all files
- `payload/` - Encrypted database chunks
- `*.js` - Application code
- `styles.css` - Styling

## Hosting Requirements

For the viewer to function correctly, your web server must set:

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

The included service worker (sw.js) handles this automatically for
most static hosts (GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, etc.).
